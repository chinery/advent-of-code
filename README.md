# Advent of code
This is a place to store my solutions for the yearly [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) programming puzzles. At least, as far as I get each year before work commitments mean I can't keep up! One year I'll do the full thing (update: 2020 was the first, all 25 complete!)

I am by no means competitive on the global leaderboard because I do not want to wake up at 5am. The code is just for fun and not perfect, but if you want to see a bit of how my brain works, go ahead!

For 2018 and 2019 my input for each puzzle is stored in a text file with the same name as the question, which I read in by redirecting stdin. Written in Python 3.

For 2020 I am using C++. Inputs are stored in the data subfolder. There is a .vscode folder set up with the build task using clang.

Enjoy!
