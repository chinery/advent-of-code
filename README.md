# Advent of code
This is a place to store my solutions for the yearly [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) programming puzzles. At least, as far as I get each year before work commitments mean I can't keep up! One year I'll do the full thing (looking at you 2020).

I am by no means competitive on the global leaderboard. The code is just for fun and just for me, not designed for others, but if you want to see a bit of how my brain works, go ahead!

My input for each puzzle is stored in a text file with the same name as the question, which I read in by redirecting stdin. Everything is written in Python 3.

Enjoy!
